# INTRODUCTION
This project, for my Database Systems class, is a python program which utilizes psycopg2 to run SQL queries on a database schema. 
The program includes functions which count the unique number of departing passengers from a specified airport, updates the payment information
for flight passengers given a specified date of departure, and promotes flight crew members based on years worked and number of flights.
